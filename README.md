##Introduction
__Linux__ is an operating system. Linux is used fairly widely because it offers a higher level of control via a few different methods.
1. __Linux is open source__: Its source code is available hence can change and can be manipulated as one pleases.
2. __Linux offers granular control__: You have infinite amount of control over the system . Everything can be controlled by the terminal at the miniscule level or the most macro level. Linux makes sxripting in any of the scripting simple and effective.
3. __Linux is transparent__: You can see and manipulate its working parts.
###Introductory terms and concepts
1. __Case Sensitivity: Linux is very case sensitive. Desktop/desktop/deskTop are not similar. “file or directory not
found” this error will be indicated in such a case.
2. __Directory: This provides a way of organising files. 
3. __Root: This is an admin account to be used by a trusted person who can do anything e.g change passwords, add users etc.
4. __Home: This is a directory where files created are saved by default.
5. __Binaries: These are files that can be executed and they generally reside in the */usr/sbin* or *usr/bin*.
6. __Terminal: command line interface (CLI)
7. __Shell: This is the environment running commands on Linux. 
8. __Script: Series of commands run in an interpretive environment that converts each line to source code.
###The Linux Filesystem.
At the top of the filesystem is the root */*
Important subdirectories are:
1. __*/root*: Home directory of the root user.
2. __*/bin*: Where application binaries reside.
3. __*/etc*: The configuration files are contained here. 
4. __*/lib*: Where you'll find *libraries.*
5. __*/home*: This is user's home directory.
6. __*/mnt*: This is where other file systems are mounted or attached to the filesystem.
7. __*/media*: This where USBs and CDs are usually mounted on the filesystem.
